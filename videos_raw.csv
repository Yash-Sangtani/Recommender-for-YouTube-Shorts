Save and share these recipes to hit your protein goals !

✅ 460 Calories
✅ 28 g Protein 

2 slices bread
45 g Besan
100 g Thick Yoghurt (I used high protein yoghurt which has 12 g protein in 100 g & is about 100 calories)
Tomato, Cucumber, beetroot, onion & potato slices
Coriander chutney & sandwich masala

🌟 Vishesh Tippani
- Let the batter cook slowly before you flip it but if is too soft, it shall break
- Cool it before you make the sandwich, I usually use a rack to cool it to prevent it from becoming soggy

As a vegetarian, do you agree, the protein struggle is REAL ! Bombay sandwich toh aapne bohot khaya hoga but is sandwich mein 28 g protein hai & about 460 calories.

🔷 9 Best PROTEIN Foods for DIABETICS #unitedstates 

Managing diabetes doesn’t mean limiting your meals—it means choosing smarter, healthier foods that help stabilize blood sugar and support long-term wellness. 
In this video, discover the 9 best high-protein foods for people with diabetes and why these options are essential for improving insulin sensitivity, balancing blood sugar, reducing inflammation, and keeping you full longer. Ideal for type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and anyone seeking stable energy and healthier eating.

🟢 Healthy Protein Sources for Diabetes
✅ Salmon
Rich in omega-3s, lean protein, and naturally carb-free, salmon helps improve insulin sensitivity, support blood sugar control, reduce inflammation, and lower the risk of cardiovascular complications and high blood pressure—conditions commonly associated with diabetes.

✅ Chicken Breast
High in protein, low in carbs and fat, it helps you stay full longer, reduces cravings, and prevents sudden blood sugar spikes.

✅ Eggs
Packed with protein that slows sugar absorption, eggs have a glycemic index of 0 and provide healthy fats that keep you full and help prevent rapid increases in blood glucose. Choose boiled or steamed preparation.

✅ Greek Yogurt
High in protein, low in sugar, and rich in probiotics, Greek yogurt helps slow carbohydrate absorption, prolong satiety, reduce inflammation, and improve blood sugar control.

✅ Tofu
Low glycemic index, rich in protein and isoflavones. Tofu slows sugar absorption, reduces post-meal spikes, improves insulin sensitivity, and helps maintain stable glucose levels.

✅ Lentils
Low-GI, rich in soluble fiber and plant-based protein, lentils slow digestion and sugar absorption, preventing blood sugar spikes after meals.

✅ Almonds
Contain fiber, protein, healthy fats (omega-3 & omega-6), and plenty of magnesium—all of which slow sugar absorption, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce post-meal blood sugar surges.

✅ Cottage Cheese
(Cottage cheese, ricotta)
 High in protein and fat with a low GI, it slows carbohydrate absorption, increases satiety, and reduces cravings for sweets. Choose low-fat, low-sugar, low-sodium options and eat in moderation.

✅ Quinoa
Low glycemic index, high in fiber, complete high-quality protein (with all essential amino acids), magnesium, and antioxidants. Quinoa helps slow sugar absorption, improve insulin sensitivity, and may support prevention of type 2 diabetes more effectively than many common grains.

🔷 Cooking Tips
✔️ Recommended: Steaming, boiling, baking, grilling, or pan-searing with minimal oil.
 ✔️ Avoid: Deep-frying and processed meats (sausages, cured meats).
❇️ Closing
Take control of your health—start adding these high-protein, diabetes-friendly foods to your daily meals and feel the difference in your energy, blood sugar, and overall well-being.

The recent VIT Bhopal student protest began after hundreds of students fell sick due to a major jaundice outbreak on campus, which they believe was caused by contaminated drinking water and unhygienic hostel food. Students claimed that complaints about foul-smelling water, poor sanitation, and inadequate medical facilities had been ignored for months. Tension escalated when videos surfaced allegedly showing hostel staff mistreating students who had raised these issues. On the night of the protest, nearly 4,000 students gathered, and the situation turned violent—vehicles, including buses and an ambulance, were vandalised or torched, and parts of the administration area were damaged. The university temporarily shut down the campus and declared holidays, while the Madhya Pradesh government issued notices to the institute and launched an investigation.

Ingredients:
For the Crust:
2 cups crushed vanilla wafer cookies (Nilla Wafers) or shortbread cookies
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
For the Coconut Cheesecake Layer:
1 (8 oz) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon coconut extract
1 (8 oz) tub whipped topping (Cool Whip), thawed (divided use)
For the Pudding Layer:
2 packages (3.4 oz each) instant coconut cream pudding mix
2 ¾ cups cold milk
For the Topping:
Remaining whipped topping
1 ½ cups sweetened shredded coconut
Red and green holiday sprinkles
Instructions:
Make the Crust: In a medium bowl, combine the crushed vanilla wafers and melted butter. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place in the freezer for 10 minutes to set.
Make Cheesecake Layer: In a large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese, powdered sugar, and coconut extract until smooth and creamy. Gently fold in 1 cup of the whipped topping. Spread this mixture carefully over the chilled crust.
Make Pudding Layer: In another bowl, whisk together the instant pudding mixes and cold milk for 2 minutes until it begins to thicken. Spread the pudding layer over the cream cheese layer.
Top: Spread the remaining whipped topping over the pudding layer.
Garnish: Sprinkle the shredded coconut generously over the top to look like snow. Add the red and green sprinkles for a festive touch.

I’ve lost over 100 pounds, and the biggest game changer was this: I started making high protein, low carb meals and sauces that actually taste GOOD.

Keeping things ridiculously simple, bold, and satisfying has been the secret. This bowl is all of that: packed with about 50g of protein, low in carbs, and full of flavor. I used my Kaizen high protein rice (its got 20g protein, just 6g net carbs per serving), but you can use whatever you like: regular rice, brown rice, or even quinoa work just fine. 

Here’s how I made it: (makes 4 servings)

1.Start with the chicken. I used 1.5lbs chicken (you can use your favorite cut). Drizzle with 1 tbsp olive oil, then season with 1 tbsp each of onion powder, garlic powder, and paprika, 2 tsp ground pepper, and a generous couple pinches of salt.

2.Air fry, bake, or sear and finish in the oven at 400F for 37 to 40 minutes or until cooked through.

3.While the chicken cooks, prepare 4 servings of Rice according to instructions. I used my @kaizenfoodco protein rice here, but use what you like.

4.Make the salad: Slice 4 Persian cucumbers into thin half moons, quarter a big handful of cherry tomatoes, finely dice half a red onion, and chop a handful of fresh mint or lemon basil. Add the zest of a lemon, juice of a lemon, 2 tbsp olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Toss well, taste and adjust.

5.For the sauce: In a food processor, blend 1/2 cup Greek yogurt, 2 tbsp mayo, 1 tbsp olive oil, juice of 3 limes, 1 garlic clove, a big handful of basil and chives (2 to 3 tbsp each), salt and pepper. Add 1 to 2 tbsp cold water to thin if needed!

6.Plate it up: Add rice, a few spoonfuls of salad, sliced or chopped chicken, and a few tablespoons of the basil-chive sauce. Finish with crumbled feta (about 1/4 oz per serving), chili flakes, more herbs & sesame seeds

It doesn’t feel like a “healthy” meal… it just tastes really, really good


ENJOY!

_bLSglM5T1k,UC2qnIrCWvhPtye-ckv3YRng,SHREDHAPPENS,2025-12-05T15:30:22Z,🥦 High-Protein Broccoli Feta Soup,"🥦 High-Protein Broccoli Feta Soup

This high protein broccoli feta soup is as good as it gets. It’s got roasted broccoli & feta as the star ingredients, with two of my favorite protein hacks cottage cheese and bone broth making it high protein and super filling. It’s perfect for meal prep, lunch, or a dinner that leaves you full without feeling heavy. The roasted broccoli comes out almost a little nutty, and it’s the perfect texture when it’s all blended.

Total (whole recipe):
984 calories · 78g protein

Per serving (4 servings):
246 calories · 19.5g protein · 10g carbs

Ingredients:

5 cups (450g) broccoli florets, cut small so they roast evenly
2 cups baby spinach
1 small yellow onion, quartered
4 garlic cloves, peeled
1 tbsp olive oil
3 cups bone broth (I used K&F)
1/2 cup cottage cheese
6oz feta cheese (reserve a little for topping)
Zest and juice of ½ large lemon
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp chili flakes (plus extra for garnish)
Salt and pepper to taste
Optional: Fresh dill and finely shredded Parmesan or Manchego for garnish

Here’s how I made it:

1️⃣ Preheat oven to 415°F

2️⃣ Cut the broccoli into small florets so it roasts evenly and cooks faster.

3️⃣ Toss broccoli, onion, and garlic with olive oil, oregano, chili flakes, salt, and pepper. Tuck the feta in the corner. Roast for 28–30 mins until golden and slightly crisp at the edges.

4️⃣ Add roasted veggies to a blender with bone broth, spinach, cottage cheese, lemon zest, and juice. Blend until smooth and creamy.

5️⃣ Warm through in a pot, taste and adjust seasoning, then garnish with fresh dill, chili flakes, and finely shredded Parmesan or Manchego.

If you make it, be sure to let me know on SHREDHAPPENS! 

Enjoy!
